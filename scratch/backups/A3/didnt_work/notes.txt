-total area 16x16 km
-The aircraft is controlled by supplying desired linear velocity and angular velocity (V and ω) that the on-board systems immediately responds to, as long as these controls are within operational parameters of aircraft.
-The controlled linear velocity cannot be less than a terminal velocity (50 m/s). above max velocity (900 m/s)
-The combination of linear and angular velocity cannot exceed 6G (safety limit for the pilot : calculated as V * ω / g ; g being gravitational force)
-A watchdog timer in the control systems monitors that control input is supplied every 50ms (5ms tolerance)
-The aircraft is twice as fast as the bogies (bogie top speed limited to 450m/s.
-A high-precision INSGPS that provides the aircraft precise pose (x,y and θ)
-An directional radar that provides range and bearing to the bogies (from the aircraft) updating at 100Hz
-Receive readings from a radar situated at the base station that provides range and velocity to bogies (from the base station) at 10Hz (the basestation is at location x= 0 y=0).

tasks:
- The aircraft task is to localise enemy aircraft (bogies) that enters the airspace and intercept the aircraft
- Obtain data from the aircraft and the ground station
- Utilise the data to estimate the bogie position and display the estimated position on the simulator
- In order to intercept, linearly extrapolate the bogie position in time
- Estimate a control action that will lead to your aircraft intercepting the bogie (pure pursuit)
- Control the aircraft within the watchdog imposed limits and aircraft specification envelope (terminal velocity / max velocity / max G profile).
- Stay within the workspace around the base station (total area is 16kmx16km with base station in middle).
- Intercept as many aircraft as possible
